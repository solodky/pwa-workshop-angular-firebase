Welcome to the workshop of building a production ready Progressive Web App based on Angular, Ionic and Firebase.

This workshop consists of multiple steps for producing a PWA by transforming a regular web app - [Ionic Conference App](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-conference-app/) into a PWA, optimizing it for various platforms and powering it up with Firebase services.

## Ionic Conference App

The end application is purely a kitchen-sink demo of a PWA based on Ionic Framework and Angular. We will be using some of Ionic's UI components and services with Angular for creating a uniform and native-like user experiences in multiple platforms.

**We will not use Ionic for building a hybrid mobile app, but instead we will use it for building a PWA!**

## How this workshop works?

Since we depend on Angular CLI and some other tools which are not available for online code editor environments, we're going to develop and build the app on our local computers.

**Every next step/branch includes the solution of the previous step.**

> If you're stuck at any of the steps, you can switch to the next step/branch and continue from there. Note that you need to discard your local changes on git when you checkout a solution.
